📞 "Please Hold: The Game"
Genre: Comedy Puzzle / Point-and-Click Adventure
Style: Narrative-driven, fourth-wall-breaking, absurd humor

🌐 Concept:
You wake up in a void with nothing but an old phone and a note that reads: “Call your way out.”
Every number you dial leads to a bizarre scenario—some are silly, others have cryptic clues, and a few break the rules of the game itself. Your goal? Escape the hotline labyrinth, one chaotic call at a time.

☎️ Features:
Weird Calls: Over 100 numbers with unique, hilarious results (talking ducks, confused AI, evil fridges).

Puzzle Mechanics: Use clues from previous calls to figure out what number to dial next.

World-Hopping: Some calls "glitch" the game and teleport you to unexpected zones (like Monkey Comedy Club or the Breadverse).

Fourth-Wall Breaks: The game occasionally talks back, gaslights you, or pretends to crash.

🎭 Tone:
Lighthearted chaos with random story twists, surreal humor, and unexpected moments—perfect for players who love nonsense, jokes, and weird logic.
